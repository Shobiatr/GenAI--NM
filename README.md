Realistic face generation remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with applications spanning entertainment, virtual reality, and biometrics. Existing autoencoder models often struggle to produce realistic and diverse facial images due to the complexity of facial features. In this research, we propose a deep autoencoder architecture specifically tailored for realistic face generation tasks, incorporating advanced CNN techniques to overcome these shortcomings. The encoder network extracts hierarchical features from input facial images, while the decoder network reconstructs faces with enhanced fidelity. Central to our approach is the integration of transposed convolutional layers in the decoder, facilitating the generation of high-resolution facial images.
